# Numeral Data Protector
## Numeral Data Protector v1.4


Description:
This class contains methods for encrypting and decrypting text using a custom encryption algorithm.
The encryption algorithm uses a randomly generated key and XOR operation to scramble the original text, 
and also converts a given string into an integer array.

This algorithm is versatile and can be executed on multiple platforms and devices, including embedded microcomputers, 
as well as low-level and high-level programming languages. It utilizes text-to-decimal conversion, enabling it to operate 
and preserve data in platforms that do not support complex coding such as Unicode, UTF, and others.

Arduino, PlatformIO, Espressif compatible
